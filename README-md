------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

now follow that command with another one but, this time I will be using the model:generate argument to define my Contact model and its attributes, as follows:

$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize model:generate --name Contact --attributes firstName:string,lastName:string,phone:string,email:string
The --name parameter is obviously the name of the model to be generated and the --attibutes parameter is followed by the object fields that define it along with their data types. The outputs of this command are two new files:

models/contact.js - a data model to be used in the Node.js application logic code
migrations/yyyymmddHHMMSS-create-contact.js - a migration script that will issue DDL SQL to create the contacts table in the database
In addition to the attributes specified in the model:generate command sequelize-cli will also generate an auto-incremented integer id field as well as as createdAt and updatedAt date-link fields.

Next up to do is to run the migration so that the SQLite database will contain the contacts table as follows:

$ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
